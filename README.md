# DS-Nitro
My attempt at an open source DS flashcart.

The goal for this project is to create a DS flash cart that is open source, IDK if this exists currently but I want it too.


Required Features:
1. Works on the DS and DS lite.
2. Supports sd cards up to sdhc.
3. Can save game save files to the sd card directly.
4. Can automatically patch games, the same as what most moddern ds flash carts can do.


Nice to have Features:
1. Supports sd cards up to sdxc.
2. Works with ds download play.
3. Has a built in IR for games that can untilise it.
4. Works with the ds rumble pak and the ds ram pak.
5. Can run emulators that emulate NES, SNES, GB, GBC, MS, MD, etc.
6. Can work on the 3DS, 2DS, New 3DS, New 2DS and DSi
7. Cheats system.


Potential Features, really extra features that I don't plan to implement until everything else is done or mostly done.
1. Built in CPU and RAM a bit like the Supercard dstwo, hopefully a lot more powerful one that can emulate consoles such as the 3DS, New 3DS or PSP.
2. The built in RAM can be utilised by applications such as the DS Internet Browser and emulators that would usually use a slot 2 RAM pak.
3. An internet card and internet browser that have far expanded capabilities to the original, supporting moddern protocols and modern browser features.
