# DS-Nitro
My attempt at an open source DS flashcart.

The goal for this project is to create a DS flash cart that is open source, IDK if this exists currently but I want it too.

Required Features:
1. Supports sd cards up to sdhc.
2. Can save game save files to the sd card directly.
3. Can automatically patch games, the same as what most moddern ds flash carts can do.

Nice to have Features:
1. Supports sd cards up to sdxc.
2. Works with ds download play.
3. Has a built in IR for games that can untilise it.
4. Works with the ds rumble pak and the ds ram pak.
5. Can run emulators that emulate NES, SNES, GB, GBC, MS, MD, etc.
6. Can work on the 3DS, 2DS, New 3DS, New 2DS and DSi
